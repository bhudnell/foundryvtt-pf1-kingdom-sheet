        <p>If a building requires another to be adjacent (such as how a Tavern
        must be adjacent to a House or Mansion), and that required building is
        demolished or destroyed, the GM may decide that the associated building
        goes out of business or otherwise shuts down 1d3 turns later because of
        lack of customers or support. If this occurs, you lose the building’s
        benefit and Unrest increases by 1.</p><p>If you build a replacement for
        the abandoned building, on the next Upkeep phase you may attempt an
        Economy check to activate the abandoned building; success means the
        abandoned building is occupied and provides its bonuses. If you fail,
        you may keep trying on the next turn.</p>

        <p>Instead of Cathedrals, Shrines, and Temples providing the same
        bonuses to Economy, Loyalty, and Stability regardless of that building’s
        religious affiliation, they can instead provide a bonus to an attribute
        related to the alignment of the god worshiped.</p><p>A Temple increases
        attributes as follows: </p><ul><li><em>Chaotic</em>: Loyalty
        +2</li><li><em>Evil</em>: Economy +2</li><li><em>Good</em>: Loyalty
        +2</li><li><em>Lawful</em>: Economy +2</li><li><em>Neutral</em>:
        Stability +2

        <ul><li>Apply this twice if the god’s alignment is simply Neutral, not
        Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. </li></ul></li></ul><p>A Cathedral
        increases these attributes by 4 instead of 2. A Shrine increases one
        attribute, and only by 1; for example, a lawful good Shrine increases
        Economy by 1 or Loyalty by 1.</p><p>Instead of granting alignment-based
        bonuses, a religious building may grant bonuses based on the portfolio
        of its chosen god. For example, a Temple of the goddess of wine may
        increase Economy and Loyalty (the same attributes as a Tavern) each by
        2, and a Temple of the god of greed may increase Economy and Stability
        (the same attributes as a Black Market) each by 2. These values replace
        the building’s normal modifiers to Economy, Loyalty, and Stability, and
        should never provide bonuses greater than the building’s normal bonuses
        (+1 for a Shrine, +4 for a Temple, +8 for a Cathedral).</p>

        <p>As explained in the Buildings section, the Settlement entry for a
        building lists modifiers that affect skill checks in the
        settlement.</p><p> If the GM wants these modifiers to influence the
        kingdom as a whole, add up the Settlement modifiers for all settlements
        in your kingdom, divide them by 10, and apply the following adjustments
        according to your kingdom’s alignment: </p><ul><li><em>Chaotic</em>: +1
        Crime</li><li><em>Evil</em>: +1 Corruption</li><li><em>Good</em>: +1
        Society</li><li><em>Lawful</em> +1 Law</li><li><em>Neutral</em>: +1
        Lore 

        <ul><li>Apply this twice if the kingdom’s alignment is simply Neutral,
        not Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Use these
        total modifiers everywhere in your kingdom. If a settlement has its own
        settlement modifier, use the higher of the two modifiers for rolls
        relating to that settlement.</p>

        <p>Kingdoms gain notoriety for the actions of their leaders and
        citizens, as well as for constructing certain types of buildings. This
        leads to the development of Fame or Infamy. Fame represents a positive
        perception of a kingdom—it’s seen as a place of culture, learning,
        peace, and honor—as well as reflecting its measure of success in
        diplomacy, trade, and battle. Infamy represents a negative perception of
        a kingdom—it’s perceived as treacherous, corrupt, prejudiced, ruthlessly
        warmongering, and villainous.</p><p>As a kingdom grows, it can gain and
        lose both Fame and Infamy, but these are not opposite statistics—an
        increase in Fame does not mean an equal decrease in Infamy. For example,
        a kingdom may be famous for culture and learning as well as infamous for
        treachery and corruption.</p><p>These Fame and Infamy values are not
        associated with the <a
        href="https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Reputation%20and%20Fame&amp;Category=Campaign%20Systems">Reputation
        and Fame campaign system</a>.</p><p><strong>Starting Values</strong>:
        When you found a kingdom, it starts with Fame 1 or Infamy 1 (Ruler’s
        choice). The other value starts at 0. Fame and Infamy cannot go below 0.
        Certain buildings (such as Arenas and Castles) increase Fame. Some
        events (such as Squatters or Visiting Celebrity) can increase or reduce
        Fame or Infamy. </p><p><strong>Settlement Modifiers</strong>: Add all
        the Lore and Society modifiers from all your settlements and divide by
        10; add this amount to your Fame. Add all the Corruption and Crime
        modifiers from all your settlements and divide by 10; add this amount to
        your Infamy.</p><p><strong>Size Increases</strong>: When your kingdom’s
        Size increases to 11, 26, 51, 101, and 201, Fame or Infamy (Ruler’s
        choice) increases by 1. </p><p><strong>Using Fame and Infamy</strong>:
        Fame and Infamy affect skill checks relating to other kingdoms. For
        every 10 points of your kingdom’s Fame, your citizens gain a +1 bonus on
        Diplomacy checks to influence government officials of other kingdoms.
        For every 10 points of your kingdom’s Infamy, your citizens gain a +1
        bonus on Intimidate checks to influence government officials of other
        kingdoms.</p>

        <p>The kingdom-building rules presume your government is a feudal
        monarchy; the leaders are appointed for life (either by themselves or an
        outside agency such as a nearby monarch), and pass their titles to their
        heirs. The form of government you choose can help establish the flavor
        and feel of the kingdom and also adjust its settlements’ modifiers. You
        may choose one of the following as the kingdom’s government.
        </p><p><strong>Autocracy</strong>: A single person rules the kingdom by
        popular acclaim. This person may be elected by the people, a popular
        hero asked to lead, or even a hereditary monarch who rules with a light
        hand. <em>Modifiers</em>: None.</p><p><strong>Magocracy</strong>: An
        individual or group with potent magical power leads the kingdom and
        promotes the spread of magical and mundane knowledge and education.
        Those with magical abilities often enjoy favored status in the kingdom.
        <em>Modifiers</em>: Lore +2, Productivity –1, Society
        –1.</p><p><strong>Oligarchy</strong>: A group of councilors, guild
        masters, aristocrats, and other wealthy and powerful individuals meet in
        council to lead the kingdom and direct its policies. <em>Modifiers</em>:
        Corruption +1, Law –1, Lore –1, Society
        +1.</p><p><strong>Overlord</strong>: The kingdom’s ruler is a single
        individual who either seized control or inherited command of the
        settlement and maintains a tight grasp on power. <em>Modifiers</em>:
        Corruption +1, Crime –1, Law +1, Society –1.
        </p><p><strong>Republic</strong>: The kingdom is ruled by a parliament
        of elected or appointed officials who represent the various geographic
        areas and cultural constituents of the kingdom, making decisions for the
        whole through voting, bureaucratic procedures, and coalition-building.
        <em>Modifiers</em>: Crime –1, Law –1, Productivity +1, Society +1.
        </p><p><strong>Secret Syndicate</strong>: An unofficial or illegal group
        like a thieves’ guild rules the kingdom—the group may use a puppet
        leader to maintain secrecy, but the group pulls the strings.
        <em>Modifiers</em>: Corruption +1, Crime +1, Law –3, Productivity +1.
        </p><p><strong>Theocracy</strong>: The kingdom is ruled by the leader of
        its most popular religion, and the ideas and members of that religion
        often enjoy favored status in government and the kingdom.
        <em>Modifiers</em>: Corruption –1, Law +1, Lore +1, Society –1.</p>

        <p>Each leadership role provides bonuses to kingdom statistics based on
        one of the leader’s ability scores. The GM may want to allow a leader’s
        ranks in a relevant skill (such as Diplomacy or Intimidate) to also
        affect the kingdom statistics. For every 5 full ranks in a relevant
        skill, the leader may increase the leadership modifier by an additional
        1. These skill-based additional bonuses modify the standard leadership
        role bonuses in the same way that the Leadership feat grants additional
        bonuses.</p><p>The relevant skills for each leadership role are as

        to keep or discard them if they interfere with the campaign’s intended
        style of play.</p>

        <p><strong>Government:</strong> This entry lists how the settlement is
        governed and ruled. The type of government a settlement follows affects
        its statistics.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> A settlement’s
        alignment is the general alignment of its citizens and government—
        individuals who dwell therein can still be of any alignment, but the
        majority of its citizens should be within one step of the settlement’s
        overall alignment. Alignment influences a city’s
        modifiers.</p><p><strong>Qualities:</strong> All settlements have a
        certain number of qualities that further adjust their statistics—think
        of qualities as feats for settlements. A settlement’s type determines
        how many qualities it can have.</p><p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
        Any disadvantages a settlement might be suffering from are listed on
        this line. A settlement can have any number of disadvantages you wish to
        inflict on it, although most settlements have no
        disadvantages.</p><p><strong>Max Base Value:</strong> This section lists
        the community’s maximum base value for available magic items in gp. The
        total bonus provided by certain buildings can never increase past this
        value.</p><p><strong>Purchase Limit: </strong>A settlement’s purchase
        limit is the most money a shop in the settlement can spend to purchase
        any single item from the PCs. If the PCs wish to sell an item worth more
        than a settlement’s purchase limit, they’ll either need to settle for a
        lower price, travel to a larger city, or (with the GM’s permission)
        search for a specific buyer in the city with deeper
        pockets.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> Unlike magic items,
        spellcasting for hire is listed separately from the town’s base value,
        since spellcasting is limited by the level of the available spellcasters
        in town. This line lists the highest-level spell available for purchase
        from spellcasters in town. Prices for spellcasting appear on page 159 of
        the Core Rulebook. A town’s base spellcasting level depends on its
        type.</p>
