# Kingdom Sheet

## Summary Tab

The kingdom's size is the sum of the hex types in the terrain tab.

## Leadership Tab

The ruler and spymaster can choose what kingdom stat(s) their bonus will affect with the drop down in each of their rows.

Viceroys can be added with the add viceroy button (+ icon) in the top right corner of the tab.

## Settlements Tab

Settlements can be added with the create settlement button on the secondary nav bar (+ icon).

There is also a "unassigned items" button on the secondary nav bar (house icon). This will list all the buildings and settlement features that arent assigned to a settlement or district (buildings only). Items in this list do not apply their bonuses to the kingdom until correctly assigned.

## Summary Tab

Shows the basic info about the settlement.

### Districts Tab

This tab includes the district grid, district borders, and a list of buildings assigned to this district, but not placed in the district grid. Some buildings should belong here (city walls, paved streets, etc) while some should not. Buildings that dont belong here will show an error and will not apply their bonuses to the kingdom/settlement stats.

In the district grid:
- double clicking a building will open the building sheet to edit it
- right clicking a building will open a context menu to delete or edit the building

### Features Tab

Shows the list of settlement features (qualities, disadvantages, and miscellaneous).

### Magic Items Tab

If a building that provides a magic item slot is destroyed/damaged the slots will remain on the page with a warning that there are more items than slots. Manually deleting slots can be done by clicking the trash can icon on the slot.

## Terrain Tab

The "Hex Types" section shows the types of hexes the kingdom has claimed. The sum of these fields is your kingdom's size.

## Events Tab

The roll event button will roll the event chance, then roll on the event table to determine the event (if one takes place).

## Armies Tab

Dragging an army actor onto the kingdom sheet will create a link to the army accessible in this tab.

The create army button (+ icon) will create a new army actor in the world and create a link to it.

The delete army button (trash can icon) will only delete the link to the army. The army actor will remain in the world.

## Notes Tab

Pretty self explanatory.

## Settings Tab

Checking the second ruler checkbox will change the consort role to act as a second ruler.

# Kingdom Changes

## Max Base Value and Purchase Limit

The values for these changes are percentage increases/decreases, not flat numbers. All percentages from all changes will be totaled before being applied to the settlement's max base value/purchase limit

### example
A value of 50 in one change should equate to a 50% increase while -30 in another change should be a 30% decrease so the overall effect is a 20% increase
